One day in the laboratory, you are working alongside Rival.  Time is moving so slowly, as you tinker through experiment after experiment.  You feel regret that your tech might be used for weapons, but you hope you can unlock something to help humanity.

During your lunch break, you're flipping through an old History Book on the island of (Enigu|Cryptipelago).  Rival says he heard rumors that the island had been discovered and that it actually exists.  Dumbfounded, you say that you thought that it had sunk into the sea, that no one would ever find it again.

Rival returns with a flyer that is soliciting help for a voyage to Enigu, asking for Scientists, Linguists, Mercenaries, and Sailors.  You and Rival decide to sign up. You sign up to be sent out with the next ship.

You go and say goodbye to your Mother first, and she warns you to steer clear of the the places where wild Pokemon roam free.  She reminds you that occasionally people can keep Pokemon as pets, but only until they grow to strong.  Their iron-wills and aggressive nature can get the best of them, regardless of bonds.

She gives you a backpack, your Notebook (which serves as your Pokedex, Journal, Synthesis Recipe Book, and Cryptographic Log) and you're on your way.

On the ship, your Rival talks about how it was believed that the people of CP had the ability to bond with Pokemon, which you confirm.  And he asks about the medicines and balms that the Islands contain.  

Your Rival talks about how much money could be made if you sold that.  You disagree.  You feel like it should be used to help others.

You arrive at the island, and hop out and look around.  As you do, you see tons of trees with berries, coconuts, and the vibrant sounds of Pokemon - this island is teeming with them!

You see a Growlithe off in the distance that's taken an interest in you.  Warily, you approach.  It seems kind, but also unsure of you as well. You follow it off into the bushes and from the tall grass, you hear Rival talking to a Mercenary.  They talk about how stoked they are to weaponize all of this, and how they received commands from Lorenz to eliminate all who stand in their way.  This is their chance to make their mark in the Great War.

You shout out to your Rival that you had expected more of him.  When they see you, they say "looks like we found our first target".  Growlithe jumps from the bushes and bites the Mercenary.  Without hesitation, it turns and pushes you deeper into the forest.  You follow.  

Once your confident that you lost them, you search your surroundings.  You find the remnants of an old village that was abandoned long ago.  You stumble inside, exhausted.  But you see that your new friend was hurt in the skirmish.  You look around for a bandage, and find a vessel with strange markings on the side.  (the markings display as the one for healing).  You rub it on the wound, and you sleep for the night.  

When you awaken, you realize the Growlithe is still there, and his wound has healed completely.  You realize that the symbol must have had something to do with restoring or healing.  You rummage around the village and find a room with characters on all the walls, slate along one of them, with etchings of different characters being put together.

In the corner is a tattered scroll, that shows a recipe.  You recognize the two berries on the page, and a strange constellation shape, which are combined and cooked, and set out to find them (they'll be on trees in the village, so don't let the player leave). 

Using the crucible in the corner of the room, you create a small fire beneath it and mix the berries.  The crucible breaks, but you manage to save and store the potion in a clay vessel. You get a potion added to your bag. 

You realize that you need to go back to the base camp and steal some lab supplies to continue your research.  You set out to go and get them.

You sneak in the back, grab your stuff, and as you exit, you encounter Rival.  He talks about how this was the plan all along, but that they needed your translating and historical skills.  He offers you to join with them, but when you refuse, he summons his own Pokemon Ally.  It doesn't obey him much, but it gets the job done. 

If you don't defeat him, rollback to the "setting out to get supplies" scene.  

When you defeat him, you see genuine concern in his eyes.  You can tell he believes what he's doing is right, but that there is still remorse.  You were his best friend, but he has made his choice.  

You hurry back to the village and as you head back, you come across a natural spring.  You go to wash your face and you feel the scratches and cuts heal as they wash.  You get your Pokemon to wash in it as well, and it fully heals.

Strange.  Perhaps this is where the berries get their healing properties?  These healing springs?  You take note and continue the journey back to camp. 

When you get back to the village, you enter other buildings.  One has a huge map on a scroll on the wall. You take the scroll down, and now you have an Island Map.  This is added to your menu.

You look and see a large building to the North and decide to head that way.  As you do, you encounter someone along the path.  They are friendly and named Benji, and say that they escaped as well.  You share with him your potion recipe and he sets out to make some to help you on your journey.  He has friends who defected as well, and he'll share his information with them as he encounters them (this establishes stores in every region)

Shop Keepers will often have a few of the synthesizable items on hand, but when they don't you can provide them with the materials to make the items, and they'll manufacture them for you.  

As you arrive at the gates to the huge building, you see a pedestal with a bowl with a constellation on it.  You press down on it and realize that its some scale of some sort.  You recognize that star shape from before.  This gate requires stardust to enter.

(Next time you talk to the friendly NPC down the road, you tell him about Stardust and from then on, you can purchase items from him with it).

Down a different fork, you find a vessel with the same constellation on it. It's full of stardust  You go back to the gate, pour it in, and when it fills to the brim, the gate summons a creature that you fight, and then the gate opens. And it deposits five spheres of some sort.  Each is fitted with a red ruby.  When you hold it out, to examine, it, it absorbs your Growlithe.  You're shocked!  You've never seen anything like that.  But once you do, you feel a strange bond.  A presence of some sort.  You press on the ruby embedded on the ball, and out comes Growlithe.  It doesn't seem out of the ordinary to him.  You don't fully understand, but you feel a stronger connection.

This is all so strange.  

(Next time you talk to the friendly NPC down the road, you tell him about pokeballs, but neither of you knows how to make them).

As you pass through, you see that this region is warmer, stickier.  It's more tropical.  You see a spring, which establishes this area as the "pseudo town".  Benji's friend Charlie, follows you through and sets up shop saying he was just talking to his friend Benji when he saw the gate open.  He wanted to see if he could figure out how to make these Pokeballs, but isn't sure where to start.

In this region, there are ruby gems, apricorns, stardust, and a mix of Bug Pokemon and Flying Pokemon
